## “The more you know, the more you know you don't know.”  ― Aristotle


The thought of "how much I don't know and what I can't do yet" I am trying to turn into "wow, that is so exciting how much room for an improvement I have" :) . Even though it doesn't work sometimes, I can clearly see how much I have developed my skills since the first day of this class. As smart people say: "Don't try to be better than the others, try to be better than yourself yesterday".
