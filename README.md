# Project 1. Exploratory Visualization
## 1. Prospectus

In connection with the current situation of COVID - 19 (Coronavirus) in the world, I decided to look back and see what other epidemic diseases had threated human race for the past years. One of the most dangerous and rapidly spreaded viruses was Ebola in 2013 - 2016 years. The data I will use for my project was found in https://www.kaggle.com. 

With a final number of 28,616 infected people, including 11,310 deaths (case-fatality rate of 40%), The Western African Ebola virus epidemic (2013–2016) was the most widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in history—causing major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region, mainly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
