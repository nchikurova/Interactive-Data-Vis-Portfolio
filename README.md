# Project 1. Exploratory Visualization
## 1. Prospectus

In connection with the current situation of COVID - 19 (Coronavirus) in the world, I decided to look back and see what other epidemic diseases had threatened human race for the past years. One of the most dangerous and rapidly spreaded viruses was Ebola in 2013 - 2016 years. The data I will use for my project was found in [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com). 

With a final number of 28,616 infected people, including 11,310 deaths (case-fatality rate of 40%), The Western African Ebola virus epidemic (2013–2016) was the most widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in history—causing major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region, mainly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. *[Ebola Outbreak Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/ebola-outbreak-20142016-complete-dataset)

How fast was EVD distribution among the countries provided in dataset? What is the percentage of number of confirmed deaths comparing to possible deaths, as well as confirmed cases to possible cases? How long did it take these countries and the rest of the world to recover form EVD epidemic? How far was the peak of the desease from the end of it?

Even though Coronavirus and Ebola are not the same epidemic cases, I think some of the answers of those questions will help people now days to understand what to expect and how to react towards such cases, as well as understanding and realization of how strong and smart we are together to live through this. 
I am planning to find more datasets that will describe how the governments and poeple themselves were fighting with the virus, and what was the most helpful.
