                I was born and
                raised in Russia. My mom’s first child was born when she was 24, my aunt had two children by the age of
                20. Some of my best friends now at the same age as me have 6-years old kids. I will be 30 in few months,
                and the question “Where are the grandchildren?” had kept coming from my mom during the last few years.
            </p>
            <p>Life styles and life priorities are very different now days comparing
                to
                our parents’ life, especially in Russia, considering post-communism period and the result of it life
                conditions they had to face. So, I decided to take a look at the data of women’s age at their first
                birth
                for the past 40 years or so.

            <h2>A little history</h2>
            <div class="history">
                <p>Russia is one of the many Eastern European countries that experienced fertility decline in the
                    beginning
                    and the middle of the 1990s. Among different social, economic and political reasons for each
                    country,
                    for Russia, in particular, the collapse of the USSR was one of the main reasons. The fertility
                    decline
                    had caused changes in the average age of starting families in many Eastern European countries, but
                    somehow did not affect Russia:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p style="font-weight:bold"> <strong>Average age at marriage in Russia</strong></p>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1987:</strong> 24.2 - men, 21.4 - women</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1989:</strong> 24.4 - men, 21.8 - women</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even though the average number of children per family decreased from the
                    beginning of the 20th century till its end, women continued to give birth to their first child at
                    young
                    ages.
                    The overall picture of the average age at birth by birth order has started to change after the
                    2000s.

                    <p>Let's take a look at the analysis of the data taken from Census-based Period Fertility tables
                        that show how the proportion of women at birth by birth order has changed with their age from
                        1979 to 2010.<br><br>
                        The proportion of women at giving first birth has its peak at 19-20 years old for both
                        years
                        1979 and
                        1989.<br><br>
                        Already from 1979 to 1989 we can see the pattern of a third, fourth and fifth births curves
                        slightly
                        moving to the right – to older ages. All of these three curves are spreading through the
                        ages,
                        which
                        means that in 1989 third, fourth and fifth and more births were given at older ages than in
                        1979.

                    <br><br>The pattern of a long high pick for the first birth curve has changed on third graph; the
                    curve of proportion of women giving a first birth is almost leveled up with other curves in
                    2002.<br>
                    As for the first birth the ages of women would be 18 to 26 years old, instead of a high peak at 18
                    to 20 years old in 1979 and 1989.<br><br><br>
                    If the peak of the first birth curve would fall for 20-24 years old in 2002, 2010 shows us a new
                    picture. The peak in 2010 has moved from 22 years old to 26, which gives us a strong pattern of
                    moving
                    the average age at giving a first birth to older ages.

                    To have a clear image of women's age at first birth let’s compare together the curves of
                    first
                    births for all four years.
                    <br>
                    If in 1979 and 1989 the curves are very similar to each other, 2002 curve has its peak at
                    older
                    age
                    and
                    distributed among older ages. In 2020 more women keep giving births to their first child
                    from 24
                    years
                    old to 38-40, then in 1979 and 1989. The curve of 2010 continued the tendency of “aging” and
                    its
                    peak
                    has moved to 24 years old and the curve itself covers fewer births at younger ages (18 – 24)
                    and
                    more
                    births at older ages (24 – 38).

                to
                compare the number of births given by women at these ages from 1950 to 2010.
                <br>
                As we can see the most births were given by women from 20-24 and 25-29 years old age groups.
                <br>
                The number of births given by young women at the age of 15 to 19 was almost as high as for 30-34
                years
                old group from 1970 to 2005.
                After 2005 this number went down, while the number of births given by women at the age from 30
                to 34
                tripled since that time.

            <p class="conclusion">
                There are thousands of reasons why Russian women have been having their first child in the early
                twenties: whether it has been a historically developed tradition that goes centuries beyond or
                the
                choice made under the social and family pressure.
                <br>However, the pattern of getting married and
                having
                a
                first child at younger ages has started to change. Why? The economic situation in Russia has
                become
                better since the post-communism period, the middle class now has access to traveling and
                exploring
                the
                world before settling and having a family. Young women nowadays have a stronger mind, they do
                not
                get
                influenced by “old school” traditions anymore, and, maybe make a choice of becoming
                psychologically
                and
                professionally mature before having their first child.
