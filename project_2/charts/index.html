    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:verdana"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The research question for this
        article comes from the personal
        life
        experience. I was born and
        raised in Russia. My mom’s first child was born when she was 24, my aunt has two children by the age of 20. Some
        of my best friends at the same age as me have 6-years old kids. I will be 30 in few months, and the question
        “Where are the grandchildren?” had kept coming from my mom during the last few years.
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can see that I am not alone and life styles and life priorities are very
        different now days
        comparing to
        our
        parents’ life, especially in Russia, considering post-communism period and the result of it life conditions they
        had to face. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, I decided to take a look at the data of women’s age at their
        first birth for the past 40 years
        or so.
        <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let’s talk about history for a moment. The tradition of getting married and
        giving birth to a first child at
        early age in Russia has been continued for many years.
        The average age at marriage in 1987 was 24.2 years for men
        and 21.4 years for women in; in 1989, it was 24.4 and 21.8, respectively.
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Russia is one of the many Eastern European countries that experienced fertility
        decline in the beginning and the middle of the 1990s(1). Among different social, economic and political
        reasons for each country, for Russia, in particular, the collapse of the USSR was one of the main reasons.
        The fertility decline had caused changes in the average age of starting families in many Eastern European
        countries,
        but somehow did not affect Russia. Even though the average number of children per family decreased from the
        beginning of the 20th century till its end,
        women continued to give birth to their first child at young ages.

        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The overall picture of the average age at birth by birth order has started to change
        after the 2000s. <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the tradition of making a family in early twenties might have its roots deep into
        Russian
        culture,
        post-war baby boom and artificially stimulated pronatalist measures, then why the fertility decline in the
        beginning of the 1990s did not affect the average age of having a first child? Moreover, the teenage fertility
        rate at those
        years increases until its peak before 1993.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The answer to this question is not necessary the unchangeable tradition,
        but additional social and economic factors after the USSR collapsed. Since having a second child become less
        common during the most unstable years of the Russian transition to a capitalist economy in the 1980s and 1990s
        (Barkalov
        2005), this tendency remained even stronger and continued to affect the total fertility rate up to 1999.
        Vishnevskii (2006,
        194) explains the different timing of family formation in Russia and the rest of Europe primarily with Russia’s
        low
        access to modern contraceptives and the low culture of family planning in Russia. Young people in post-war
        Europe
        started sexual life earlier, but in Russia, this more often led to unplanned pregnancies, childbirth, and
        marriage (Rotkirch
        2000).
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout history, Russia and Eastern Europe have been distinguished by early
        marriage and early birth of the
        first child in connection with marriage (Therborn 2004). In the 1990s, childbearing in Western, Northern and
        most of Southern Europe peaked among women between 25 and 29 years old. By contrast, in Eastern Europe and
        Russia, childbearing peaked among women between 20 and 24 years old (Vishnevskii 2006, 184 94).

        <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will the tradition of having first child in early ages in Russia remain for
        another century?
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        ALet's take a look at the analysis of the data taken from Census-based Period Fertility tables that show how the
        proportion of women at birth
        by birth order has changed with their age from 1979 to 2010 (2).
        <br> <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Proportions of women by birth order</strong>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of women at giving first birth has its peak at 19-20 years old for
        both years 1979 and 1989.
        The area underneath these curves tall and narrow, which means that the most first birth was given by women from
        18 to 24 years old. The curves of the second births are a lot wider than the first ones, which means that the
        distribution of women giving a second birth prolongs through more years of women’s life and mostly takes place
        from 21 to 34 years old. Already from 1979 to 1989 we can see the pattern of a third, fourth and fifth births
        curves slightly moving to the right – to older ages. All of these three curves are spreading through the ages,
        which means that in 1989 third, fourth and fifth and more births were given at older ages than in 1979.
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pattern of a long high pick for the first birth curve in 1979 and 1989 has
        changed; the curve of proportion
        of women giving a first birth is almost leveled up with other curves in 2020. We can still see the ages of
        giving birth are respectively adding up along with the birth number, however, more women give births in 2002 at
        older ages. As for the first birth the ages of women would be 18 to 26 years old, instead of a high peak at 18
        to 20 years old in 1979 and 1989. Since we are most interested in the average age of first birth, let us move
        forward to the year 2010. If the peak of the first birth curve would fall for 20-24 years old in 2002, 2010
        shows us a new picture. The peak in 2010 has moved from 22 years old to 26, which gives us a strong pattern of
        moving the average age at giving a first birth to older ages.
        <br><br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let us now take a look at the curve of first births for all four years (3). By
        putting together all four
        curves of first births, we can see the
        8
        pattern of changing clearer. If in 1979 and 1989 the curves are very similar to each other, 2002 curve has its
        peak at older age and distributed among older ages. In 2020 more women keep giving births to their first child
        from 24 years old to 38-40, then in 1979 and 1989. The curve of 2010 continued the tendency of “aging” and its
        peak has moved to 24 years old and the curve itself covers fewer births at younger ages (18 – 24) and more
        births at older ages (24 – 38).
        <br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        <strong>3. Proportions of women at giving first birth</strong>
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the graph 4 we are looking at four 5-year age groups:
        15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34
        years old to compare the number of births given by women at these ages from 1950 to 2010, and the projection of
        giving births 2010 to 2020. As we can see the most births were given by women from 20-24 and 25-29 years old age
        groups. From 1965-1970 almost half out of all births were given by women of 20 to 24 years old, however, after
        2000 the number of births by that age group began to lower, while the number of births by 25-29 years old women
        exponentially growing. Also, let us pay attention to the other two age-groups – 15-19 and 30-34. The number of
        births given by young women at the age of 15 to 19 was almost as high as for 30-34 years old group from 1970 to
        2005. After 2005 this number went down, while the number of births given by women at the age from 30 to 34
        tripled since that time. By analyzing the number of births by 5-year old age group of women, we get the same
        results as from previous analyzes: after the 2000s the average age of women at giving birth keeps increasing.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite fertility declines, for the past century women in Russia have been having a
        first child at young ages.
        The fertility decline has been affecting the average number of children per family, but not the average age of
        women at giving birth to a first child. All previous analyses in this paper have shown that the average age of
        women at first birth in Russia started decreasing after the 2000s despite the traditions. There are thousands of
        reasons why Russian women have been having their first child in the early twenties: whether it has been a
        historically developed tradition that goes centuries beyond or the choice made under the social and family
        pressure. However, the pattern of getting married and having a first child at younger ages has started to
        change. Why? The economic situation in Russia has become better since the post-communism period, the middle
        class now has access to traveling and exploring the world before settling and having a family. Young women
        nowadays have a stronger mind, they do not get influenced by “old school” traditions anymore, and, maybe make a
        choice of becoming psychologically and professionally mature before having their first child.
