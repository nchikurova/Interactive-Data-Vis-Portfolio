            <p> The research question question for this article comes from the personal life experience. I was born and
                raised in Russia. My mom’s first child was born when she was 24, my aunt had two children by the age of
                20. Some of my best friends now at the same age as me have 6-years old kids. I will be 30 in few months,
                and the question “Where are the grandchildren?” had kept coming from my mom during the last few years.

            </p>
            I can see that I am not alone and life styles and life priorities are very different now days comparing to
            our parents’ life, especially in Russia, considering post-communism period and the result of it life
            conditions they had to face. So, I decided to take a look at the data of women’s age at their first birth
            for the past 40 years or so.

            <p>
                Russia is one of the many Eastern European countries that experienced fertility decline in the beginning
                and the middle of the 1990s(1). Among different social, economic and political reasons for each country,
                for Russia, in particular, the collapse of the USSR was one of the main reasons. The fertility decline
                had caused changes in the average age of starting families in many Eastern European countries, but
                somehow did not affect Russia. Even though the average number of children per family decreased from the
                beginning of the 20th century till its end, women continued to give birth to their first child at young
                ages.


                <br>The overall picture of the average age at birth by birth order has started to change after the
                2000s.

                Will the tradition of having first child in early ages in Russia remain for another century?<br>Let's
                take a look at the analysis of the data taken from Census-based Period Fertility tables that show how
                the proportion of women at birth by birth order has changed with their age from 1979 to 2010 (2).

                The proportion of women at giving first birth has its peak at 19-20 years old for both years 1979 and
                1989.
                Already from 1979 to 1989 we can see the pattern of a third, fourth and fifth births curves slightly
                moving to the right – to older ages. All of these three curves are spreading through the ages, which
                means that in 1989 third, fourth and fifth and more births were given at older ages than in 1979.

                The pattern of a long high pick for the first birth curve in 1979 and 1989 has changed; the curve of
                proportion of women giving a first birth is almost leveled up with other curves in 2020.
                <br>
                As for the first birth the ages of women would be 18 to 26 years old, instead of a high peak at 18 to 20
                years old in 1979 and 1989.
                <br>
                If the peak of the first birth curve would fall for 20-24 years old in 2002, 2010 shows us a new
                picture. The peak in 2010 has moved from 22 years old to 26, which gives us a strong pattern of moving
                the average age at giving a first birth to older ages.

                Let’s now take a look at the curve of first births for all four years (3). By putting together all four
                curves of first births, we can see the pattern of changing clearer.
                <br>
                If in 1979 and 1989 the curves are very similar to each other, 2002 curve has its peak at older age and
                distributed among older ages. In 2020 more women keep giving births to their first child from 24 years
                old to 38-40, then in 1979 and 1989. The curve of 2010 continued the tendency of “aging” and its peak
                has moved to 24 years old and the curve itself covers fewer births at younger ages (18 – 24) and more
                births at older ages (24 – 38)

                At the graph 4 we are looking at four 5-year age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34 years old to
                compare the number of births given by women at these ages from 1950 to 2010.
                <br>
                As we can see the most births were given by women from 20-24 and 25-29 years old age groups.
                <br>
                The number of births given by young women at the age of 15 to 19 was almost as high as for 30-34 years
                old group from 1970 to 2005.
                After 2005 this number went down, while the number of births given by women at the age from 30 to 34
                tripled since that time

            <p>
                There are thousands of reasons why Russian women have been having their first child in the early
                twenties: whether it has been a historically developed tradition that goes centuries beyond or the
                choice made under the social and family pressure. However, the pattern of getting married and having a
                first child at younger ages has started to change. Why? The economic situation in Russia has become
                better since the post-communism period, the middle class now has access to traveling and exploring the
                world before settling and having a family. Young women nowadays have a stronger mind, they do not get
                influenced by “old school” traditions anymore, and, maybe make a choice of becoming psychologically and
                professionally mature before having their first child.
