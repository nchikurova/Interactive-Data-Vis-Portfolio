# Project 2. Narrative Visualization

Originally being born and raised in Russia, I notice some traditions change over time. And, after another question from my mom: Where are my grandchildren?, I decided to take a look at the Russian fertility data over time. Analysing fertility tables and the age of women at birth from 1970 to 2020, as expected, I found out I was right. I am not the one in my late 20s, who does not have kids yet. the average age of women at first birth in Russia started decreasing after the 2000s despite the traditions. There are many reasons for that change, and I am going to talk about it in my article.
