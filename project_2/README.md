## 1. Prospectus

Born and raised in Russia, I notice that some traditions has been changing over time. And, after another question from my mom: "Where are my grandchildren?", I decided to take a look at the Russian fertility data over time. Analysing fertility tables and the age of women at birth from 1970 to 2020, I found out that the average age of women in Russian at their first birth had increased. I am not the one in my late 20s, who does not have kids yet. The average age of women at first birth in Russia started increasing after the 2000s despite the traditions.

## 3. Exploring data and Data sources:

This article is a short version of my research paper, where I took the data from the sources listed below and made analysis myself by comparing, exploring and combining the data of Russian population over time, Fertility tables and Cohort tables, and Total Fertility Rates tables.

I decided to include the line chart of Total Fertility Rates of some Eastern European countries to show overall picture of fertility decline in late 1990s; line chart of proportions of women by birth order (1979, 1989, 2002, and 2010 were the years with the most updated information and the least missing values); and the bar graph of the numbers of birth by 5-year age group of mother.

## 4. Reflection and Iteration

## 5. Improvement and goals for future

## To make this project perfect I would:

- make all elements interactive and connected to the dropdown menu
- replace the dropdown menu with either radio buttons or checkboxes (since it is only three countries and it is possible to show the viewer all options at once)
- make a map more interactive by adding hover over the surface area, and fixing the bug in hover over borders
- brainstorm and add the idea for displaying proportions and percentage of affected people comparing to the population in each country
- change scatter plot to line chart where I could display tooltip by using ClosestDate and bisect function
- debug Guinea circle tooltip (the tooltip are not showing maybe because the radius is too small and all circles are on a top of each other)
- replace separate HTML div containers that represent lines connected circles and countries on a map by adding them to code ( so each line will show up only when the country is chosen)
- brainstorm and improve the idea of showing "2015 <--- 2014 ---> 2015" HTML element for representing the growth of numbers over time
- brainstorm the ideas and add the answer on question from Prospectus "How the governments and people themselves were fighting with the virus, and what was the most helpful"
