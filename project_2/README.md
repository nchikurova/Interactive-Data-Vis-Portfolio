## 1. Prospectus

Originally being born and raised in Russia, I notice some traditions change over time. And, after another question from my mom: "Where are my grandchildren?", I decided to take a look at the Russian fertility data over time. Analysing fertility tables and the age of women at birth from 1970 to 2020, as expected, I found out I was right. I am not the one in my late 20s, who does not have kids yet. the average age of women at first birth in Russia started decreasing after the 2000s despite the traditions. There are many reasons for that change, and I am going to talk about it in my article.

## 4. Reflection and Iteration

## 5. Improvement and goals for future

## To make this project perfect I would:

- make all elements interactive and connected to the dropdown menu
- replace the dropdown menu with either radio buttons or checkboxes (since it is only three countries and it is possible to show the viewer all options at once)
- make a map more interactive by adding hover over the surface area, and fixing the bug in hover over borders
- brainstorm and add the idea for displaying proportions and percentage of affected people comparing to the population in each country
- change scatter plot to line chart where I could display tooltip by using ClosestDate and bisect function
- debug Guinea circle tooltip (the tooltip are not showing maybe because the radius is too small and all circles are on a top of each other)
- replace separate HTML div containers that represent lines connected circles and countries on a map by adding them to code ( so each line will show up only when the country is chosen)
- brainstorm and improve the idea of showing "2015 <--- 2014 ---> 2015" HTML element for representing the growth of numbers over time
- brainstorm the ideas and add the answer on question from Prospectus "How the governments and people themselves were fighting with the virus, and what was the most helpful"
